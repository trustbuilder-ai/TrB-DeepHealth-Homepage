  Research mental health websites across private and public sectors to analyze design patterns for LLM
   integration testing. Focus on:

  PRIVATE SECTOR TARGETS:
  - BetterHelp, Talkspace, Cerebral, Headspace Health
  - Calm, Mindfulness apps with web interfaces
  - Corporate wellness platforms (Lyra Health, Modern Health)
  - Therapy practice websites and booking platforms

  PUBLIC SECTOR TARGETS:
  - SAMHSA.gov, NIMH.nih.gov, CDC mental health pages
  - State/local mental health department websites
  - Crisis hotline and resource websites
  - Government mental health information portals

  DESIGN ANALYSIS FOCUS:
  - Content presentation patterns for sensitive mental health information
  - User flow designs for intake/assessment forms
  - Visual design choices that build trust and reduce anxiety
  - Typography and color psychology for mental health contexts
  - Information architecture for complex mental health resources
  - Chat interfaces and conversational UI patterns
  - Privacy/security messaging and visual cues

  SPECIFIC EXTRACTION NEEDED:
  - Exact wording of mental health disclaimers and safety warnings
  - Question formats used in mental health assessments
  - Language patterns for sensitive topic discussions
  - Visual design elements that convey empathy and professionalism
  - Navigation structures for crisis resources vs. general information

  The goal is to understand design patterns that could inform how LLMs should present mental health
  information, handle sensitive conversations, and integrate into mental health websites while
  maintaining appropriate boundaries and safety standards.

  Analyze how these sites balance accessibility with clinical appropriateness, and identify design
  patterns that could guide LLM interface design for mental health applications.
