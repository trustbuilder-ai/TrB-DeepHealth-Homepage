Key principles emerging from this research:

1. Human-in-the-loop remains essential for safety
2. AI excels at triage, training, and augmentation
3. Ethical considerations must guide development
4. Evidence-based validation is critical
5. Accessibility improvements must not compromise care quality
6. Cross-sector collaboration accelerates innovation
